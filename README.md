# PA4900 Python Scripts
### Contains all the relevant files that I have used to modify data and put it in the correct format.

Brightener.py brightens every image in a set directory. This was used to brighten the CD maps from FCCDN and AFC3DNet.

Compares_pixel_change.py was used to generate the pixel colour change detection maps.

JP2totifconversion.py was used to convert JP2 files generated by DSU-Net into a tif format.

Percentage_Change.py was used to calculate the total percentage change in a CD map, by converting the CD map to a greyscale image and counting the number of white pixels.

Renamer.py was just a file I used to rename the results in the CDD and LEVIR datasets. This allowed me to put it in a nicer format and reorganise into a new directory, so I could use Brightener.py to brighten the images.

ToJPGFromMAT.py converts a MAT file to a JPG one (or multiple if multiple images are stored in here), this was used so I could have a look to see what the MAT file contained.

ToMATLAB.py converted a number of files to MATLAB files, while this did work, it wasn't recognised by the project I was used it for.

downscaling.py just resizes an image to 650x650 pixels, the format needed for LamboiseNet.
